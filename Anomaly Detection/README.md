# Pipeline for Anomaly Detection

### Concept: 
Also known as outlier detection, anomaly detection is a data mining process used to determine types of anomalies found in a data set and to determine details about their occurrences. Automatic anomaly detection is critical in todayâ€™s world where the sheer volume of data makes it impossible to tag outliers manually. Auto anomaly detection has a wide range of applications such as fraud detection, system health monitoring, fault detection, and event detection systems in sensor networks, and so on.  

### Applications:  
- fraud detection 
- system health monitoring 
- fault detection
- event detection systems in sensor networks

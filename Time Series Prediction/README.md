# Pipeline for Time Series Prediction  
Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.  

Time series are widely used for non-stationary data, like economic, weather, stock price, and retail sales in this post.

Considering a system using machine learning to detect spam SMS text messages. Our ML systems workflow is like this: Train offline -> Make model available as a service -> Predict online.  
- A classifier is trained offline with spam and non-spam messages.
- The trained model is deployed as a service to serve users.
In this article, we will focus on both: building a machine learning model for spam SMS message classification, then create an API for the model, using Flask, the Python micro framework for building web applications.This API allows us to utilize the predictive capabilities through HTTP requests.
